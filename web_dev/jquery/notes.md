Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. 

1. What sorts of resources will help? 
 
 * Google jQuery to get a general idea of the language
 * Find some jQuery documentation and cheatsheets

2. How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? 

* I'm planning to read as much as I can before testing what I learned from memory, so I can avoid copy-pasting code

3. Make a few notes on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

* I usually learn quickest by doing, so doing while researching would probably work best for me
* coming up with different ways I could use jQuery and trying out different things usually also help me figure out what to search for and where to go deeper
