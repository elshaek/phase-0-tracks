Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. 

1. What sorts of resources will help? 
 
 * Google jQuery to get a general idea of what the library does
 * Find some jQuery documentation and cheatsheets - **https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ was really helpful**

2. How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? 

* I'm planning to read as much as I can before trying what I learned from memory, so I can avoid copy-pasting code - **this did not work. I had to keep referring back to the examples to make sure the syntax was correct**

3. Make a few notes on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

* I usually learn quickest by doing, so doing while researching would probably work best - **as expected, this approach was the most helpful in learning the material**
* coming up with different ways I could use jQuery and trying out different things usually also help me figure out what to search for and where to go deeper
