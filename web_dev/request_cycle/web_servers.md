###9.1 Release 1: Research Web Servers

**1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?**
 
 The Linux OS philosophy revolves around the idea that all of its users know what they're doing, and that all the tools provided will empower them to do anything they want to accomplish. Therefore, flexibility, simplicity, and freedom are important considerations for the OS.

**2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?**
 
 A VPS is a chunk of memory that is walled-off from the outside world and runs like a computer, that is sold as a service to users. Users can run the OS of their choice and basically do almost everything that they can normally do on a computer running on that OS.
 Advantages: Lower cost compared to dedicated server; easy and quick to configure.

**3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?**
 
 Running programs as the root user will pose security problems, as any bug/viruses can affect the underlying system or even destroy it.
