3. **Optional bonus question:** What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

 A cookie is a piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. This data is then stored in the browser and used again when the user goes back to the website and makes a request to the same server.

 Cookies are mainly used for: 

 i. Session management: Logins, shopping carts

 ii. Personalization: User preferences, themes

 iii. Tracking: Recording user behavior
