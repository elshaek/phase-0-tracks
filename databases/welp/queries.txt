RELEASE 2: View a Many-to-Many Relationship

1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
- command:
SELECT * FROM businesses JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id;

- output: 
6|Sushi World|1|5|great food!|6|2|2|Mandy|Kaling
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|2|5|Like something out of a postcard!|1|5|5|Holly|Berry
5|Plumbing by Janet|3|4|Plumber was late but service was good.|5|7|7|Denzel|George


2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
- command:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id;

- output:
Mandy|Kaling|Sushi World|5|great food!
Holly|Berry|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Like something out of a postcard!
Denzel|George|Plumbing by Janet|4|Plumber was late but service was good.

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
- command:
SELECT * FROM businesses JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id WHERE businesses.id = 6;

- output:
6|Sushi World|1|5|great food!|6|2|2|Mandy|Kaling
