In the solo_project directory, create a file called queries.txt. For each SQL query you run, paste both the command and the output (if any) into queries.txt.

Run a SQL query for each of the following:

1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
- command: SELECT * FROM employees;
- output:
1|John|Doe|1987-12-12|Coordinator|2
2|Jane|Doe|1990-10-10|Associate|1
3|Steven|White|1986-05-05|Manager|4
4|Melinda|Harris|1963-06-06|VP|3
5|Catherine|Moss|1960-03-13|Director|5

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
- command: 
UPDATE employees SET position="Manager" WHERE first_name="Jane" AND last_name="Doe";
- output: none

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
- command: 
SELECT * FROM employees, departments WHERE employees.department_id = departments.id;
- output:
1|John|Doe|1987-12-12|Coordinator|2|2|HR
2|Jane|Doe|1990-10-10|Manager|1|1|Marketing
3|Steven|White|1986-05-05|Manager|4|4|R&D
4|Melinda|Harris|1963-06-06|VP|3|3|Accounting and Finance
5|Catherine|Moss|1960-03-13|Director|5|5|Purchasing

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
- command:
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, employees.position, departments.name FROM employees JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
- output:
John|Doe|Coordinator|HR
Jane|Doe|Manager|Marketing
Steven|White|Manager|R&D
Melinda|Harris|VP|Accounting and Finance
Catherine|Moss|Director|Purchasing

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
- command: DELETE FROM employees WHERE id=1;
- output: none
