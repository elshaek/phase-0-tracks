* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system that allows the management of changes to files by recording these changes over time. It is useful because it lets users recall previous versions of the files, compare changes made across different versions, see who had worked on a specific version, identify a specific version of a file that might have caused problems, recover lost files, and recover a last working file.

* What is a branch and why would you use one

A branch is a version of a repository. A repository usually includes a master branch, and whatever other branches or versions that the user has created. By working with different branches other than the master branch, the user can make changes and test them without affecting the main working files or code, and without creating multiple directories for the different versions.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit creates a save point to record changes to the repository, after changes were made in files and staged. A good commit message should explain concisely the changes that were made in a file/folder.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is a occurence where the current branch and the branch the user is trying to merge with each has information or commits that is not present in the other. When there are disagreeing changes, user has to resolve the conflict by deciding what the final result should be.
