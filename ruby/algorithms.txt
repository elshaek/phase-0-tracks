__ALGORITHM FOR USING AN ELEVATOR__

(Assumptions: 
A. Each floor already has an assigned value equivalent to its floor number, e.g. B1 = -1; 3rd floor = 3
B. There is only 1 column of buttons in the elevator, with the lowest floor at the bottom, and highest floor at the top)

1. Find out which floor we want to go to (“destination floor”)
2. Make sure the “destination floor” exists, if not, keep requesting until valid floor number is given
2. Start at the the most bottom button for the lowest floor in the building (“current floor button”)
3. Repeat the steps below until “current floor button” is equal to “destination floor”:
    - Move up 1 button
    - Add 1 to current floor value and update 
4. Once “current floor button” is equal to “destination floor”, press the button 
 



__ALGORITHM FOR BUYING GROCERIES ON A BUDGET__

(The goal is to buy as many items as possible, and as close to the budget as possible)

1. Set budget (“budget”)
2. Figure out number of items to buy
3. Find out the price of each item
4. Arrange list from cheapest to most expensive
5. Add all the item prices (“total price”)
6. Until “total price” is less than or equal to “budget”, repeat the steps below:
    - Find out how much the total price exceeded the budget (“overrun”)
    - Starting from the cheapest item, repeat the below process:
	- If the item price is equal to or greater than the “overrun”
	    - Remove item and update list of items
	    - Update total price
	    - Stop checking for the rest of the items and checkout
	- Otherwise check on the next item
    - If none of the items were removed
	- Remove the most expensive item and update list of items
	- Update total price and repeat 6.
7. If “total price” is less than or equal to “budget”, go to cashier and buy all items on the list
