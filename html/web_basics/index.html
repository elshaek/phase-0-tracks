	<h2>Pet Dogs</h2>
	<p>Choosing the right kind of dog food can be confusing with so many choices available. To narrow down your options, consider these factors:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Age</li>
		<li>Breed</li>
		<li>Health issues</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Pet Snakes</h2>
	<p>Bathing a pet snake might not seem necessary, but there are actually many benefits, such as helping to relieve constipation, killing mites and promoting shedding. Here are some tips on how to bathe your pet snake:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Fill a container with 10 cm of <strong>warm and clean, non-chlorinated water</strong>. Use a thermometer to make sure that the water temp is between 37.7 and 40.5 degrees Celsius, as snakes are extremely sensitive to temperature.</li>
		<li>Let your snake bathe itself by carefully placing it into the container, and letting it swim for about 10 minutes.</li>
		<li>Pick up your snake and <em>gently</em> dry it with a <em>soft</em> towel.</li>
	</ol>
